# Hello, my name is Vaishu !
_(Like ‘my shoe’ but with a ‘v’)._ I am a former Film and UI/UX student turned to CS Media and Intelligence. I’ve found my passions to be more focused on the logical application of coding and iterative software development in tech more than solely design, yet my background in all types of media influences my thinking in all walks of life.

As a woman of many hats, I have worked in various roles including product management, UI/UX wireframing, Arduino prototyping, mobile/web application development, marketing management, broadcast/film production, video editing, graphic design, volunteering, tutoring, and more! Different people to work with and new tools to learn from these experiences have shaped me into the versatile, compassionate, and creative thinker I am today.

**Currently, I am the Director of Communications at HexLabs, a student non-profit that hosts hackathons. I also work as a Product Manager for Bits of Good, a non-profit connecting local ATL with computer science and design-savvy students to work on technical solutions. **
